In my project, I've developed an anime recommendation system that utilizes three distinct models: Popularity Means, Cosine Similarity, and Neural Collaborative Filtering implemented with Tensorflow. This endeavor not only provides anime suggestions but also offers insights into the potential future and diverse applications of recommendation systems tailored to specific needs.
